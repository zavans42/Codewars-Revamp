## Description

**Kata's link**: [Prize Draw](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5616868c81a0f281e500005c)

To participate in a prize draw each one gives his/her firstname.
Each letter of a firstname has a value which is its rank in the English alphabet. A and a have rank 1, B and b rank 2 and so on.
The length of the firstname is added to the sum of these ranks hence a number som.

An array of random weights is linked to the firstnames and each som is multiplied by its corresponding weight to get what they call a winning number.

Example:
```
names: "COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH"
weights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]

PauL -> som = length of firstname + 16 + 1 + 21 + 12 = 4 + 50 -> 54
The *weight* associated with PauL is 2 so PauL's *winning number* is 54 * 2 = 108.
```
Now one can sort the firstnames in decreasing order of the winning numbers. When two people have the same winning number sort them alphabetically by their firstnames.

Task:

* parameters: st a string of firstnames, we an array of weights, n a rank
* return: the firstname of the participant whose rank is n (ranks are numbered from 1)

Example:
```
names: "COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH"
weights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]
n: 4
```

The function should return: "PauL"

## Detailed rules

* The weight array is at least as long as the number of names, it may be longer.
* If st is empty return "No participants".
* If n is greater than the number of participants then return "Not enough participants".


## Example

```js
rank("Addison,Jayden,Sofia,Michael,Andrew,Lily,Benjamin", [4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2], 4) // "Benjamin"
rank("Lagon,Lily", [1, 5], 2) // "Lagon"
rank("Addison,Jayden,Sofia,Michael,Andrew,Lily,Benjamin", [4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2], 8) // "Not enough participants"
rank("", [4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2], 6) // "No participants"
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
function rank(st, we, n) {
  let firstNames = st.split(',')
  let alphabet = '_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
  
  if(!st) return "No participants"
  if(n > firstNames.length) return "Not enough participants"
  
  let arr = firstNames.reduce((acc,curr,i) => {
    let som = [...curr].reduce((sum,ch) => alphabet.indexOf(ch.toLowerCase()) + sum, 0) + curr.length
    acc.push([curr,som * we[i]])
    return acc
  },[])
  
  let winningNumber = arr.slice().sort().sort((a,b) => b[1] - a[1])[n-1]
  return firstNames[arr.indexOf(winningNumber)]
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
function rank(st, we, n) {
  let firstNames = st.split(',')
  
  if(!st) return "No participants"
  if(n > firstNames.length) return "Not enough participants"
  
  let arr = firstNames.map((name,i) => {
    let som = [...name.toUpperCase()].reduce((sum,ch)=>sum+ch.charCodeAt()-64,name.length)
    return [name,som * we[i]]
  })
  
  let winningNumber = arr.slice().sort((a,b) => b[1] - a[1] || a[0].localeCompare(b[0]))[n-1]
  return firstNames[arr.indexOf(winningNumber)]
}
```
