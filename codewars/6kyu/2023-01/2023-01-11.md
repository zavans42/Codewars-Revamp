## Description

**Kata's link**: [The Supermarket Queue](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57b06f90e298a7b53d000a86)

There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

#### Input

customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.

#### Output
The function should return an integer, the total time required.


## Detailed rules

* There is only ONE queue serving many tills, and
* The order of the queue NEVER changes, and
* The front person in the queue (i.e. the first element in the array/list) proceeds to a till as soon as it becomes free.

N.B. You should assume that all the test input will be valid, as specified above.


## Example

```js
queueTime([5,3,4], 1)
// should return 12
// because when there is 1 till, the total time is just the sum of the times

queueTime([10,2,3,3], 2)
// should return 10
// because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the 
// queue finish before the 1st person has finished.

queueTime([2,3,10], 2)
// should return 12
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
function queueTime(customers, n) {
  let tills = Array(n).fill(0);

  for(let i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
    tills[0] += customers[i];
    tills.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  }

  return tills[tills.length - 1];
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
function queueTime(customers, n) {
  let tills = Array(n).fill(0);
  for (let cus of customers) {
    let i = tills.indexOf(Math.min(...tills));
    tills[i] += cus;
  }
  return Math.max(...tills);
}
```
