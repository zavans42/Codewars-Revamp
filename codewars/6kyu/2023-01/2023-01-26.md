## Description

**Kata's link**: [Santa's Master Plan](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52afd1fe8f7c52a0e1000304)

Write a function called getAttendees that takes two arguments:
1. Array containing all the names of the people Santa invited
2. An array of responses (objects) with the following structure:
```
{name: 'Easter Bunny', response: 'declined'}
```

getAttendees should return an array containing the names of all the people who accepted Santa's invitation and the names of those who did not respond to the invitation. Santa is very positive, so he is assuming those who did not respond will show up. Anyone who declined the invitation will not be attending the party. 

## Detailed rules

If nobody is attending the party, return an empty array [].


## Example

```js
getAttendees( ['Easter Bunny', 'Tooth Fairy', 'Frosty the Snowman', 'Jack Frost'] ,
   [ 
     {name: 'Easter Bunny', response: 'declined'}, 
     {name: 'Jack Frost', response: 'declined'}, 
     {name: 'Tooth Fairy', response: 'accepted'} 
   ] );// => returns ['Tooth Fairy', 'Frosty the Snowman']
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
function getAttendees(peopleInvited, responses){
  responses.forEach(person => {
    if(person.response === 'declined'){
      let index = peopleInvited.indexOf(person.name)
      peopleInvited.splice(index,1)
    }
  })
  
  return peopleInvited
}

```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
function getAttendees(peopleInvited, responses) {
  var declined = responses.reduce(function(o,v) {
    if (v.response == 'declined') 
      o[v.name] = true; 
    return o;
  }, {});
  return peopleInvited.filter(v => !declined[v]);
}
```
