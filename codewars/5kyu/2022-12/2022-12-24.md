John keeps a backup of his old personal phone book as a text file. On each line of the file he can find the phone number (formated as +X-abc-def-ghij where X stands for one or two digits), the corresponding name between < and > and the address.

Unfortunately everything is mixed, things are not always in the same order; parts of lines are cluttered with non-alpha-numeric characters (except inside phone number and name).

Examples of John's phone book lines:
```
"/+1-541-754-3010 156 Alphand_St. <J Steeve>\n"
" 133, Green, Rd. <E Kustur> NY-56423 ;+1-541-914-3010!\n"
"<Anastasia> +48-421-674-8974 Via Quirinal Roma\n"
```

Could you help John with a program that, given the lines of his phone book and a phone number num returns a string for this number : "Phone => num, Name => name, Address => adress"

## Detailed rules

* It can happen that there are many people for a phone number num, then return : "Error => Too many people: num"
* or it can happen that the number num is not in the phone book, in that case return: "Error => Not found: num"

## Example

```js
s = "/+1-541-754-3010 156 Alphand_St. <J Steeve>\n 133, Green, Rd. <E Kustur> NY-56423 ;+1-541-914-3010!\n"
phone(s, "1-541-754-3010") should return "Phone => 1-541-754-3010, Name => J Steeve, Address => 156 Alphand St."
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
function phone(strng, num) {
  // get the list of all peoples
  let peoples = strng.split('\n').filter(contact => contact.includes(num))
  if(peoples.length > 1) return `Error => Too many people: ${num}`
  
  let people = peoples[0]
  if(!people) return `Error => Not found: ${num}`
  
  // get the name
  let [startIdx,endIdx] = [people.indexOf('<'),people.indexOf('>')]
  const name = people.slice(startIdx+1,endIdx)
  
  // get the address
  const address = people
    .replace(`<${name}>`,'') // remove the name
    .replace(`+${num}`,'') // remove the phone number
    .replace(/[^\w\-\.\s]/gi,'') // remove everything that is not alphanumerical,-,. or single white space
    .replace(/\s+|_/g,' ') // remove multiple white spaces and _
    .trim() // remove trailing whitespaces
  
  return `Phone => ${num}, Name => ${name}, Address => ${address}`
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
function phone(strng, num) {
  // get the list of all peoples
  let peoples = strng.split('\n').filter(contact => contact.includes(num))
  
  if(peoples.length > 1) return `Error => Too many people: ${num}`
  if(peoples.length < 1) return `Error => Not found: ${num}`
  
  const name = peoples[0].match(/<.+>/)[0].slice(1, -1)
  const address = peoples[0]
    .replace(/<.+>|\+\d\d?-(\d{3}-){2}\d{4}|[;$*/?,:!]/g, "") // remove name, phone number, and special characters
    .replace(/_|\s+/g, " ") // remove multiple white spaces and _
    .trim() // remove trailing whitespaces
  
  return `Phone => ${num}, Name => ${name}, Address => ${address}`
}
```
