## Description

**Kata's link**: [Hello W... wait what?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54db3f2903e88ad6c30002ff/javascript)

In order to stop too much communication from happening, your overlords declare that you are no longer allowed to use certain functionality in your code!

## Detailed rules

Disallowed functionality:
* Strings
* Numbers
* Regular Expressions
* Functions named "Hello", "World", "HelloWorld" or anything similar.
* Object keys named "Hello", "World", "HelloWorld" or anything similar.

Without using the above, output the string "Hello World!" to prove that there is always a way.

## Example


```js
helloWorld() // 'Hello World!'
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
const helloWorld = function () {
  let [n,p,m] = [helloWorld.name,+true,+false]

  return n[m].toUpperCase() + 
    n.slice(p,p+p+p+p+p) + 
    String.fromCharCode(p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p) + 
    n.slice(p+p+p+p+p) +
    String.fromCharCode(p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p)
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
const helloWorld = function () {
  let one = +true
  let two = one + one
  let four = two + two
  let eight = four + four
  let sixteen = eight + eight
  let thirtytwo = sixteen + sixteen
  let sixtyfour = thirtytwo + thirtytwo
  let space = thirtytwo
  let exclamation = thirtytwo + one
  let H = sixtyfour + eight
  let e = sixtyfour + thirtytwo + four + one
  let l = sixtyfour + thirtytwo + eight + four
  let o = sixtyfour + thirtytwo + sixteen - one
  let W = sixtyfour + sixteen + eight - one
  let r = sixtyfour + thirtytwo + sixteen + two
  let d = sixtyfour + thirtytwo + four
  return [H, e, l, l, o, sp, W, o, r, l, d, excl].map(c => String.fromCharCode(c)).join([])
}
```
