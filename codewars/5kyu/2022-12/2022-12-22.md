## Description

**Kata's link**: [Longest Common Subsequence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52756e5ad454534f220001ef/train/javascript)

Write a function called LCS that accepts two sequences and returns the longest subsequence common to the passed in sequences.

<h4>Subsequence</h4>
A subsequence is different from a substring. The terms of a subsequence need not be consecutive terms of the original sequence.

<h4>Example Subsequence</h4>
Subsequences of "abc" = "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc" and "abc".

## Detailed rules

* Both arguments will be strings
* Return value must be a string
* Return an empty string if there exists no common subsequence
* Both arguments will have one or more characters (in JavaScript)
* All tests will only have a single longest common subsequence. Don't worry about cases such as LCS( "1234", "3412" ), which would have two possible longest common subsequences: "12" and "34".

## Example

```js
LCS( "abcdef" , "abc" ) => returns "abc"
LCS( "abcdef" , "acf" ) => returns "acf"
LCS( "132535365" , "123456789" ) => returns "12356"
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
function LCS(x, y) {
  let [arrX,arrY] = [x.split(''), y.split('')]
  
  return arrY.filter((ch) => {
    if(arrX.includes(ch)) 
      // remove if found
      return arrX.splice(0, arrX.indexOf(ch) + 1)
  }).join("");
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
function LCS(x, y) {
  if (!x.length || !y.length) return ''
  let longest = (x,y) => x.length > y.length ? x : y 
  return x[0] == y[0] ? x[0] + LCS(x.slice(1), y.slice(1)) : longest(LCS(x.slice(1), y), LCS(x, y.slice(1)))
}
```
