## Description

**Kata's link**: [Beeramid](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51e04f6b544cf3f6550000c1/javascript)

Let's pretend your company just hired your friend from college and paid you a referral bonus. Awesome! To celebrate, you're taking your team out to the terrible dive bar next door and using the referral bonus to buy, and build, the largest three-dimensional beer can pyramid you can. And then probably drink those beers, because let's pretend it's Friday too.

## Detailed rules

A beer can pyramid will square the number of cans in each level - 1 can in the top level, 4 in the second, 9 in the next, 16, 25...
Complete the beeramid function to return the number of complete levels of a beer can pyramid you can make, given the parameters of:
1. your referral bonus, and
2. the price of a beer can

## Example


```js
beeramid(1500, 2); // should === 12
beeramid(5000, 3); // should === 16
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
function beeramid(bonus, price) {
  const totalCansOfBeer = bonus / price;
  let [currCansOfBeer,i] = [0,1];
  
  while(currCansOfBeer < totalCansOfBeer){
    currCansOfBeer += i ** 2 // add squares of each level
    if(currCansOfBeer > totalCansOfBeer) break
    i++
  }
  
  return i-1
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
function beeramid(bonus, price) {
  for (let i = 1; i < Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER; i++) {
    let levelCans = i ** 2;
    let levelPrice = levelCans * price;
    if (bonus < levelPrice) return i - 1;
    bonus -= levelPrice;
  }
}
```
