**Kata's link**: [Find the unknown digit](https://www.codewars.com/kata/546d15cebed2e10334000ed9/javascript)

You are helping an archaeologist decipher some runes. He knows that this ancient society used a Base 10 system, and that they never start a number with a leading zero. He's figured out most of the digits as well as a few operators, but he needs your help to figure out the rest.

The professor will give you a simple math expression, of the form

```
[number][op][number]=[number]
```

Given an expression, figure out the value of the rune represented by the question mark. If more than one digit works, give the lowest one. If no digit works, well, that's bad news for the professor - it means that he's got some of his runes wrong. output -1 in that case.

Complete the method to solve the expression to find the value of the unknown rune. The method takes a string as a paramater repressenting the expression and will return an int value representing the unknown rune or -1 if no such rune exists.

## Detailed rules

He has converted all of the runes he knows into digits. The only operators he knows are addition (+),subtraction(-), and multiplication (*), so those are the only ones that will appear. Each number will be in the range from -1000000 to 1000000, and will consist of only the digits 0-9, possibly a leading -, and maybe a few ?s. If there are ?s in an expression, they represent a digit rune that the professor doesn't know (never an operator, and never a leading -). All of the ?s in an expression will represent the same digit (0-9), and it won't be one of the other given digits in the expression. No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is 0, therefore 00 would not be a valid number.





## Example

Example 1 - following tree:

```
'1+1=?' // 2
'123*45?=5?088' // 6
'-5?*-1=5?' // 0
'19--45=5?' // -1
'??*??=302?' // 5
'?*11=??' // 2
'??*1=??' // 2
'??+??=??' // -1
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
function solveExpression(exp) {
  for(let i = 0; i <= 9; i++){
    let test = exp.replace(/\?/g,i)
    // get the left and right hand side expression
    let expression = test.split('=')
    
    // it won't be one of the other given digits in the expression
    // No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is 0
    let beginWithZero = /^-?0(?=\d)/
    if(exp.includes(i) || beginWithZero.test(expression[0]) || beginWithZero.test(expression[1])) continue
    
    // calculate the left hand side expression
    let leftExp = expression[0].replace(/(-?\d+)(\+|\-(?!\d)?|\*)(-?\d+)/, (_,left,op,right) => {
      if(op == '-') return +left - +right
      if(op == '+') return +left + +right
      if(op == '*') return +left * +right
    })
    let rightExp = +expression[1]
    
    if(leftExp == rightExp){return i}
  }
  return -1
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
function solveExpression(exp) {
  // all digits that's NOT the same with other given digits in the expression
  const possibleDigits = "0123456789".split("").filter(digit => !exp.includes(digit));
  const operator = "+*-".split("").filter(operator => exp.includes(operator))[0];
  const operatorIndex = exp.substring(1).indexOf(operator) + 1;
  const leftExp = exp.slice(0, operatorIndex);
  const rightExp = exp.substring(operatorIndex + 1).split("=")[0];
  const result = exp.split("=")[1];
  
  const zeroBreak = str => (str.startsWith("?") || str.startsWith("-?")) && str.length > 1;
  
  // get rid of the zero
  if ((zeroBreak(leftExp) || zeroBreak(rightExp) || zeroBreak(result)) && possibleDigits.includes("0")) {
    possibleDigits.shift()
  }
  
  for (const candidate of possibleDigits) {
    const t = str => parseInt(str.split("?").join(candidate));
    
    switch(true) {
      case (operator === "+" && t(leftExp) + t(rightExp) === t(result)):
      case (operator === "*" && t(leftExp) * t(rightExp) === t(result)):
      case (operator === "-" && t(leftExp) - t(rightExp) === t(result)):
        return parseInt(candidate);
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```
