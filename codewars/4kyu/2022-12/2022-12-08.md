## Description

**Kata's link**: [Binary multiple of 3](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541af676b589989aed0009e7/javascript)

In this kata, your task is to create a regular expression capable of evaluating binary strings (strings with only 1s and 0s) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by 3.

Hint:
There's a way to develop an automata (FSM) that evaluates if strings representing numbers in a given base are divisible by a given number. You might want to check an example of an automata for doing this same particular task [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/140283/why-does-this-fsm-accept-binary-numbers-divisible-by-three).

## Detailed rules

* An empty string might be evaluated to true (it's not going to be tested, so you don't need to worry about it - unless you want)
* The input should consist only of binary digits - no spaces, other digits, alphanumeric characters, etc.
* There might be leading 0s.

## Example


```js
multipleof3Regex.test('000') // should be true
multipleof3Regex.test('001') // should be false
multipleof3Regex.test('011') // should be true
multipleof3Regex.test('110') // should be true
multipleof3Regex.test(' abc ') // should be false
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
const multipleOf3Regex = /^(0|1(01*0)*1)*$/;
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
const multipleOf3Regex = /^(0*(1(1|(01*0)+1))*)*$/;

/* Explanation, based on automata:

^ - start
( - outer grouping (to enfore start/end)
     - start in A
  0* - zero or more '0'
  ( - A
    1 - exit A on a 1 (enter B)
    ( - B
      1 - exit B on a 1 (enter A)
      | - or exit B on a 0 (enter C)
        01*0 - C must enter and exit on a 0, can have zero-or-more 1's
      )+ - repeat B
      1 - exit C then B on a 1
    ) - End B
  )* - repeat A
)* - repeat everything
$ - end
