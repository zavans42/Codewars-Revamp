## Description

**Kata's link**: [Sum by Factors](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54d496788776e49e6b00052f/javascript)

Given an array of positive or negative integers

```I= [i1,..,in]```

you have to produce a sorted array P of the form

```[ [p, sum of all ij of I for which p is a prime factor (p positive) of ij] ...]```

P will be sorted by increasing order of the prime numbers. The final result has to be given as a string in Java, C#, C, C++ and as an array of arrays in other languages.


## Detailed rules

* It can happen that a sum is 0 if some numbers are negative!

Example: I = [15, 30, -45] 5 divides 15, 30 and (-45) so 5 appears in the result, the sum of the numbers for which 5 is a factor is 0 so we have [5, 0] in the result amongst others.


## Example

```
I = [12, 15]; //result = [[2, 12], [3, 27], [5, 15]]
```
[2, 3, 5] is the list of all prime factors of the elements of I, hence the result.

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
function sumOfDivided(list) {
  let [result,max] = [[],2]
  list.map(num => {
    for(let i = max; i <= Math.abs(num); i++)
      if(num%i == 0 && !result.find(x => i%x[0] == 0)){
        let factor = [i,0];
        list.map(number => number%i == 0 && (factor[1] += number));
        result.push(factor);
      }
  });
  return result.sort((a,b) => a[0] > b[0] ? 1 :-1);
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
function sumOfDivided(lists){
  let [max,p,result,factor] = [Math.max(...lists.map(Math.abs)),[],[],[]]
  for(let i = 2; i <= max; ++i){
    p.some(a => i%a == 0) || 
      p.push(i) && (factor = lists.filter(a => a%i == 0)).length &&
      result.push([i,factor.reduce((a,b) => a+b)])
  }
  return result
}
```
