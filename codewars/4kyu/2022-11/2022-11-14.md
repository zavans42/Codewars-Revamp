## Description

**Kata's link**: [Most frequently used words in a text](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51e056fe544cf36c410000fb/javascript)

Write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks), returns an array of the top-3 most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.




## Detailed rules


* A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (') in ASCII.
* Apostrophes can appear at the start, middle or end of a word ('abc, abc', 'abc', ab'c are all valid)
* Any other characters (e.g. #, \, / , . ...) are not part of a word and should be treated as whitespace.
* Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.
* Ties may be broken arbitrarily.
* If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, or an empty array if a text contains no words.



## Example

```js
top_3_words("In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to
mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for
coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most
nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra
on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income.")
# => ["a", "of", "on"]

top_3_words("e e e e DDD ddd DdD: ddd ddd aa aA Aa, bb cc cC e e e")
# => ["e", "ddd", "aa"]

top_3_words("  //wont won't won't")
# => ["won't", "wont"]
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
function topThreeWords(text) {
  let map = new Map()
  let words = text.toLowerCase()
    .split(' ') // split the text with white space
    .reduce((arr,word) => {
      if(/[a-z]/.test(word)) // true if word contain a lowercase letter
        arr.push(word.replace(/[^a-z']/g,'')) // remove all non lowercase letter & push it to array
      return arr 
    },[])
  
  for(let i = 0; i < words.length; i++)
    // add the word to the map if it doesn't exist, otherwise add it's current value by 1
    map.has(words[i]) ? map.set(words[i],map.get(words[i])+1) : map.set(words[i],1)
  
  return Array.from(map)
    .sort((a,b) => b[1] - a[1]) // sort by number of occurrences
    .slice(0,3) // get the top 3 
    .map(x => x[0]) // get the word
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
const topThreeWords = text => {
  let total = (text.toLowerCase().match(/\b[a-z']+\b/g)||[]).reduce((obj,word) => (obj[word] = (obj[word]||0) + 1, obj), {});
  return Object.keys(total).sort((a,b) => total[b] - total[a]).slice(0,3);
};
```
