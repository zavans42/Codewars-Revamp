**Kata's link**: [Pyramid Slide Down](https://www.codewars.com/kata/551f23362ff852e2ab000037/javascript)

Pyramids are amazing! Both in architectural and mathematical sense. If you have a computer, you can mess with pyramids even if you are not in Egypt at the time. For example, let's consider the following problem. Imagine that you have a pyramid built of numbers, like this one here:

```
   /3/
  \7\ 4 
 2 \4\ 6 
8 5 \9\ 3
```
Let's say that the 'slide down' is the maximum sum of consecutive numbers from the top to the bottom of the pyramid. As you can see, the longest 'slide down' is ```3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23```

Your task is to write a function that takes a pyramid representation as argument and returns its' largest 'slide down'.


## Detailed rules

My tests include some extraordinarily high pyramids so as you can guess, brute-force method is a bad idea unless you have a few centuries to waste. You must come up with something more clever than that.


## Example

```
* With the input `[[3], [7, 4], [2, 4, 6], [8, 5, 9, 3]]`
* Your function should return `23`.
```

## Solutions

**My First Solution:**


```js
function longestSlideDown (pyramid) {
  for (let i = pyramid.length - 2; i > -1; i--)
    for (let j = 0; j < pyramid[i].length; j++) 
      pyramid[i][j] += Math.max(pyramid[i + 1][j], pyramid[i + 1][j + 1]);
    
  return pyramid[0][0];
}
```

**My Second Solution:**

```js
function longestSlideDown (pyramid) {
  return pyramid.reduceRight((last,curr)=>{
    return curr.map((n,i)=>n+Math.max(last[i],last[i+1])
  )})[0];
}
```
