## Description

**Kata's link**: [Sum of Intervals](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52b7ed099cdc285c300001cd/javascript)

Write a function called sumIntervals/sum_intervals() that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.


## Detailed rules

### Intervals
Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. Interval example: [1, 5] is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.

### Overlapping Intervals
List containing overlapping intervals:
```js
[
   [1,4],
   [7, 10],
   [3, 5]
]
```
The sum of the lengths of these intervals is 7. Since [1, 4] and [3, 5] overlap, we can treat the interval as [1, 5], which has a length of 4.

### Tests with large intervals
Your algorithm should be able to handle large intervals. All tested intervals are subsets of the range [-1000000000, 1000000000].



## Example

```js
sumIntervals( [
   [1,2],
   [6, 10],
   [11, 15]
] ) => 9

sumIntervals( [
   [1,4],
   [7, 10],
   [3, 5]
] ) => 7

sumIntervals( [
   [1,5],
   [10, 20],
   [1, 6],
   [16, 19],
   [5, 11]
] ) => 19

sumIntervals( [
   [0, 20],
   [-100000000, 10],
   [30, 40]
] ) => 100000030
```

## Solutions

**First:**


```js
function sumIntervals(intervals) {
  // sort by the first value of interval
  let sorted = intervals.sort((a,b) => a[0]-b[0])
  
  // define the first and second value of the FIRST interval
  let [lastFirst,lastSecond,total] = [sorted[0][0],sorted[0][1],sorted[0][1]-sorted[0][0]];

  for(let i = 0; i < sorted.length; i++){
    // define the first and second value of the CURRENT interval
    let [currFirst,currSecond] = [sorted[i][0],sorted[i][1]];
    
    // if ALL of the next interval still in range of the previous, then skip
    if(currFirst >= lastFirst && currSecond <= lastSecond){continue};
    
    // if SOME of the next interval still in range of the previous
    currFirst <= lastSecond ? total += currSecond - lastSecond : total += currSecond - currFirst;
    [lastFirst,lastSecond] = [currFirst,currSecond];
  }
  return total
}
```

**Second:**


```js
function sumIntervals(intervals) {
  let sorted = intervals.sort(([a,b], [c,d]) => a-c);
  let [max,total] = [-Number.MAX_VALUE,0];
  
  for (let [first,second] of sorted) {
    max = Math.max(max, first);
    total += Math.max(0, second-max);
    max = Math.max(max, second);
  }
  
  return total;
}
```
