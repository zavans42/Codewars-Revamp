## Description

**Kata's link**: [Numbers in strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59dd2c38f703c4ae5e000014/train/javascript)

In this Kata, you will be given a string that has lowercase letters and numbers. Your task is to compare the number groupings and return the largest number. Numbers will not have leading zeros.


## Example

```js
solve("gh12cdy695m1") = 695, because this is the largest of all number groupings.
```


## Solutions


```js
function solve(str){
  const arrOfNums = str.match(/\d+/g)
  
  return Math.max(...arrOfNums)
};
```
