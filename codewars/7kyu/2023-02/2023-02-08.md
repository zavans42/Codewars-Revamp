## Description

**Kata's link**: [Convert an array of strings to array of numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5783d8f3202c0e486c001d23)

Oh no!

Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!

You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.

Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.

Note that you can receive floats as well.


## Example

```js
["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]
```

## Solutions


```js
function toNumberArray(stringarray){
  return stringarray.map(x => +x)
}
```
