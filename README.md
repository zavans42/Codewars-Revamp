## Codewars-Revamp

A repository filled with challenges (kata) from codewars. Completed over 1500+ challenges and continually push a solution every day.

**Notes:** This is a continuation of my previous [codewars](https://github.com/zavans42/Codewars) repository with better documentation and separate .md files for each challenge for a better viewing experience. 

Here is my codewars homepage: [zavans42](https://www.codewars.com/users/zavans42)

## Language Used

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code for both efficiency and readability. 

## My Approach

Every challenge has 2 solutions, the first one is a solution that I came up with on my own, and the second one is a more refined and optimized solution after I learn from other solutions or read up further on the subject.
